## Purpose
This note taker is a user facing application. It takes input from the use in the form of a digital notepad. Using various get, post, and delete server routes the application stores user note data in a flat json database file. It then posts the notes as active items, listen in the column on the left hand side. From there the notes can be updated, or deleted.
## Challenges 
The biggest challenge of making this application was connecting the front end javascript to the back end server javascript. I solved this problem by creating an api that would  be fetched by the front end javascript. The fetch request would make get, post, or delete requests from the server. Once the server was created, routes were created for the various fetch requests that were being made.
